# Passport-Facebook

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/)
using the OAuth 2.0 API.

This module lets you authenticate using Facebook in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, Facebook authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-facebook

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The Facebook authentication strategy authenticates users using a Facebook
account and OAuth 2.0 tokens.  The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which
accepts these credentials and calls `done` providing a user, as well as
`options` specifying a app ID, app secret, and callback URL.

    passport.use(new FacebookStrategy({
        clientID: FACEBOOK_APP_ID,
        clientSecret: FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET,
        callbackURL: "http://localhost:3000/auth/facebook/callback"
      },
      function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
        User.findOrCreate({ facebookId: profile.id }, function (err, user) {
          return done(err, user);
        });
      }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'facebook'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.get('/auth/facebook',
      passport.authenticate('facebook'),
      function(req, res){
        // The request will be redirected to Facebook for authentication, so
        // this function will not be called.
      });

    app.get('/auth/facebook/callback',
      passport.authenticate('facebook', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        // Successful authentication, redirect home.
        res.redirect('/');
      });

##### Display Mode

Set `display` in `passport.authenticate()` options to specify display
mode. Refer to the [OAuth dialog
documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/oauth/)
for information on its usage. 

    app.get('/auth/facebook',
      passport.authenticate('facebook', { display: 'mobile' }),
      function(req, res){
        // ...
      });

#### Extended Permissions

If you need extended permissions from the user, the permissions can be requested
via the `scope` option to `passport.authenticate()`.

For example, this authorization requests permission to the user's statuses and
checkins:

    app.get('/auth/facebook',
      passport.authenticate('facebook', { scope: ['user_status', 'user_checkins'] }),
      function(req, res){
        // The request will be redirected to Facebook for authentication, with
        // extended permissions.
      });

## Examples

For a complete, working example, refer to the [login example](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-facebook/tree/master/examples/login).

## Issues

Facebook's OAuth 2.0 implementation has a [bug][1] in which the fragment `#_=_`
is appended to the callback URL.  This appears to affect Firefox and Chrome, but
not Safari.  This fragment can be removed via client-side JavaScript, and [@niftylettuce](https://github.com/niftylettuce)
provides a suggested [workaround][2].  Developers are encouraged to direct their
complaints to Facebook in an effort to get them to implement a proper fix for
this issue.
